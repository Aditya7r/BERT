      "The Company Becomes the Diwan\n",
      "On 12 August 1765, the Mughal emperor appointed the East India Company as the Diwan of Bengal. Now it had to think of administering the land and organising its revenue resources. This had to be done in a way that could yield enough revenue to meet the growing expenses of the company. A trading company had also to ensure that it could buy the products it needed and sell what it wanted. Being an alien power, it needed \n",

      "entirely eliminated. Revenue for the Company\n",
      "The Company had become the Diwan, but it still saw itself primarily as a trader. It wanted a large revenue income but was unwilling to set up any regular system of assessment and collection. Within five years, the value of goods bought by the Company in Bengal doubled. Now the revenue collected in Bengal could finance the purchase of goods for export. Artisans were deserting villages since they were being forced to sell their goods to the Company at low prices. Artisanal production was in decline, and agricultural cultivation showed signs of collapse. Then in 1770, a terrible famine killed ten million people in Bengal. 2 – A weekly market in Murshidabad in Bengal\n",
      "Peasants and artisans \n",
      "from rural areas regularly came to these weekly markets (haats) to sell their goods and buy what they needed. Most Company officials began to feel that investment in land had to be encouraged and agriculture had to be improved. By the terms of the settlement, the rajas and taluqdars  were recognised \n",
      "as zamindars. They were asked to collect rent from the peasants and pay revenue to the Company. The amount to be paid was fixed permanently, that is, it was not to be increased ever in future. It was felt that this would ensure a regular flow of revenue into the Company’s coffers and at the same time encourage the zamindars to invest in improving the land. The problem\n",
      "The Permanent Settlement, however, created problems. The prices in the market rose and cultivation slowly expanded. Some had lost their lands in the earlier years of the settlement; others now saw the possibility of earning without the trouble and risk of investment. 3 – Charles Cornwallis \n",

It was grown in northern Italy, southern France and in parts of Germany and Britain.

Cloth dyers in Britain now desperately looked for new sources of indigo supply. Plantation – A large farm operated by a planter employing various forms of forced labour. Plantations are associated with the production of coffee, sugarcane, tobacco, tea and cotton. Over the years many Company officials left their jobs to look after their indigo business. Those who had no money to produce indigo could get loans from the Company and the banks that were coming up at the time. There were two main systems of indigo cultivation – nij \n",
      "and ryoti. He either bought the land or rented it from other zamindars and produced indigo by directly employing hired labourers. Indigo could be cultivated only on fertile lands, and these were all already densely populated. Planters needed large areas in compact blocks to cultivate indigo in plantations. A large plantation \n",
